## Mapping Space Trash in Real Time

Today, there are more than 128million pieces of debris orbiting our planet that endanger space operations. Each time a collision happens, more debris is generated. The aim of the project is to give an overview of the position of the satellites in actual, past, and future time so we can monitor their trajectories and change them if necessary to avoid collisions. We developed a website that allows users to visualize satellites, sorted by category. The site makes predictions about its future position so the user can go through the time by using a slide bar. Finally, these coordinates are displayed when the user passes the mouse through it on the 3D visualization.
